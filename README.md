# SFCI

A package for sparse full configuration interaction (SFCI). 

## Usage

1. Enter `src/` and compile with `make`. You might need to specify the flag relating to cpu architecture. You also need to install Eigen and passing its path via `-I` flag.
2. Specify the required parameters in **sfci.input**. They are: 

    a) `Nd`: size of each Krylov vectors
    
    b) `Nl`: dimensionality of the effective Hamiltonian 
    
    c) `num_block`: maximal number of effective Hamiltonian to be diaogonalized if the calculation does not converge 
    
    d) `num_orb`: number of spin orbitals 
    
    e) `nume_e`: number of electrons
    
    f) `num_thread`: number of cores to be used
    
    g) `filename`: file name of input integral. See below for more details.

    h) `init_hf`: bitstring of the inital HF determinant written in decimal form. 
    
    i) `bucket_unit`(optional): bucket memory allocation unit size. Since there is no obvious way to predict the size of buckets in a SpMSpVM, each bucket's memory is allocated generously. The default value is 60000, which is good for the most cases. But it might still lead to overflow. If this happens, increase bucket_unit for remedy. 

3. run with 

    `./sfci`

## Reformatting Integrals

Only FCIDUMP format with integrals under the unrestricted HF orbitals is accepeted. For closed shell system this does not affect the result, but we'll make it compatible with restricted HF orbital integrals soon. Now, use `utils/convert_fci.py` to reformat FCIDUMP file:

    convert_fci.py sys1_fcidump sys2_fcidump ...

The reformated integral files will all ends with \_IN, which are now recognizable by the SFCI main program.
